# === Final 2Ã—3 Visualization of All Curves (target vs. your best trace) ===
# Usage:
# 1) Set SUBMISSION_NPY to your saved file (np.save(..., submission, allow_pickle=True))
# 2) Run. It saves figures and prints a small metrics table.

# ---- 1) Point to your final submission .npy ----

# ---- 2) Load data & tools ----

# ---- 3) Helper: evaluate a list of mechs for one problem, return idx of best distance (feasible only) ----
